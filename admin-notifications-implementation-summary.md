## Changes Made to Each Page

For each page, the following changes were made:

1. Added CSS link for notifications:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/admin/admin-notifications.css">
   ```

2. Added notification dropdown HTML:
   ```html
   <!-- Admin Notification Dropdown -->
   <div class="admin-notification-dropdown">
     <div class="admin-notification-header">
       <h3>Notifications</h3>
       <button id="admin-mark-all-read">Mark all as read</button>
     </div>
     <div class="admin-notification-list">
       <!-- Notifications will be dynamically inserted here -->
     </div>
     <div class="admin-notification-footer">
       <a href="admin-notifications.html">View all notifications</a>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

3. Added script tag for the notifications JavaScript:
   ```html
   <script type="module" src="js/admin/admin-notifications.js"></script>
   ```

## Notifications Page Features

The dedicated notifications page (`admin-notifications.html`) includes:

1. Filters for notification type (orders, inventory, appointments, tailors)
2. Filters for read/unread status
3. A "Mark All as Read" button
4. Individual controls to toggle the read status of each notification

1. Apply similar notification functionality to the tailor pages
2. Implement real-time notification updates using WebSockets
3. Add notification preferences for different types of notifications
4. Add notification sounds or browser notifications
5. Add pagination for large numbers of notifications
6. Implement notification deletion functionality
